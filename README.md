# LostAndWondering
A VR Game about a blind man who wakes up in his room. The goal is to navigate him outside the room in the least time possible using your environment to your advantage. 

Commit #1: Peter added the assets while I added the mechanics. The hex_room is dark, and the character moves automatically (you can adjust the
character's speed from the movement component in the MainCamera). The moment the character collides with the first cube in front of him (
small cube), a spotlight lights up the room. Obviously this mechanic is lackluster for the final game, but its something for you guys to 
work around. 

PLEASE DO NOT MERGE WHAT YOU UPDATE ON THE MASTER BRANCH. Make your own branch, commit all your things that you change, then when we meet we'll
see what we can add and what we don't have to add.
